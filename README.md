# `#dev-javascript` Monthly Challenges

This is a repo to collect EasyPost's monthly #dev-javascript challenges. Each challenge will not be too difficult, but shouldn't be trivial either. The ideal challenge should probably take between 10 minutes and 2 hours.

## Participation

If you wish to participate:

1. Join the #dev-javascript slack channel and Google Group
2. Check out this repo
3. Open the folder for the next month's meeting
4. Find the challenge in the `README.md`
5. Create a folder with your name
6. Go ham, solve the challenge in that folder
7. Create a PR with your solution into the repo
8. Solutions will be discussed in the next month's meeting

## Guidelines

In general, each sub-folder will be essentially it's own self-contained project. That means you can have your own

- package.json
- tsconfig.json
- node_modules
- folder structure
- whatever the heck else you want

We want to allow as much creativity as we can, so that folder is yours. As long as you don't mess with the outside repo, feel free to do what you want.

## Suggestions

Feel free to hit me up in slack, @amatthews or in the #dev-javascript channel. This is more of an experiment than anything, and if there is a better idea or some improvements to be made, I am all ears.

Happy coding.
